# brain_CTP_deconv
Deconvolving brain cell-type proportions (brain CTP) from DNA methylation data.

This repo contains code for the paper: Yap et al. 2023 "Genetic and methylomic interrogation of cellular vulnerability to autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease in the human brain".

## Scripts

`deconvolution/`: brain CTP deconvolution pipeline scripts

- ***Want to deconvolve your own bulk methylation array data (Illumina EPIC or 450K)?*** 
- [Jump right over here!](https://github.com/gandallab/brain_CTP_deconv/tree/main/deconvolution)
- This folder contains instructions and easy-to-use scripts and processed reference data (plus info on how we got there)

`qc/`: methylation and genotyping QC scripts

`analysis/`: scripts used for analysis

## Data 

- Where possible, we've tried to keep data within this GitHub repo 
- However, for larger files we've used Zenodo, but this is all described in the README within the relevant folders :)
