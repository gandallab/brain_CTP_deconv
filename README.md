## Scripts

`deconvolution/`: brain CTP deconvolution pipeline scripts

- ***Want to deconvolve your own bulk methylation array data (Illumina EPIC or 450K)?*** 
- [Jump right over here!](https://github.com/gandallab/brain_CTP_deconv/tree/main/deconvolution)
- This folder contains instructions and easy-to-use scripts and processed reference data (plus info on how we got there)

`qc/`: methylation and genotyping QC scripts

`analysis/`: scripts used for analysis

## Data 

- Where possible, we've tried to keep data within this GitHub repo 
- However, for larger files we've used Zenodo [DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7604233], but this is all described in the README within the relevant folders :)
